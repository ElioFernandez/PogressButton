# Progress Button 
Progress button designs that make a loading or unloading path and at the end the button compresses and emits a check ✅, failure ❌ or a warning ⚠️ made in SwiftUI.

It is quite pleasant to work with SwiftUI and develop interesting things like this. I leave you the examples of Button with Progress with great animations and very beautiful effects achieved using SwiftUI.

I like minimalism and that is why I think that in quite simple things you can also see beautiful designs.

Check it out below.
